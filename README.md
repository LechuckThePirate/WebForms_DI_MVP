### What is this repository for? ###

This is a simple project intended for demonstration of loose coupling classes, dependency injection and MVP layer with ASP.NET WebForms.

Technologies used:
* Entity Framework Code First with POCO entities.
* Dependency Injection (using Unity but easy to change to any container)
* WebAPI project with a simple REST method.
* Model View Presenter (MVP) to decouple UI logic from UI presentation into ViewModels and Presenters
* Unit tests
